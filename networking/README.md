# Description
Implements a server-client architecture for passing messages and/or commands between machines in every language.  Strives to adequately handle every possible exception that might occur in a coherent and comprehensive manner.

# Motivation
Having freshly graduated, I wanted to start a project that would help me maintain the skills I learned throughout my education.  I chose the task of networking from scratch because I found it to be a good challenge that pushed me out of my usual area of expertise.  I'd also like to see how the choice of programming language hampers the ease of creating a network.

# Current Goals
Write minimum program in every language that supports it:
- Determine if language is capable of networking
- Set up server to listen to messages
- Pass message from client and print on server's console
