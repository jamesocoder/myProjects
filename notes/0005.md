Unlike built-in header files, libraries aren't automatically recognized by gcc.  We must tell the compiler which libraries the project uses and sometimes also tell it where they are.

## GCC's -l option
In a call to gcc, we first list all of the component .c files.  Then we name the output file we want the finished product to be (after the -o flag).  After these 2 sections, we can also name all the library files we use in the program.  These are tagged by the -l option and their names are given immediately after (no spaces).

e.g. -lws2_32
Here, we specify that we are "linking" the ws2_32 library (Windows Sockets dll) to whatever we're building.

tldr;
Use *-l<library_name>* to link a library to your build.
