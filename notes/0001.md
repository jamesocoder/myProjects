## \#include
C's "import" keyword.  It is a compiler directive, meaning it provides instructions for the compiler.  What follows a directive is not code.  The files that are "imported" are enclosed in either:
- <> brackets:
    - The compiler will base its search for the given file relative to where C's standard libraries are
- "" quotes:
    - The compiler will base its search for the given file relative to the current file's location
    - Custom component C files are typically imported in quotations

### Component Files
Files that are written to be imported into main will still want to #include the header (.h) files they'll need for their functions.
