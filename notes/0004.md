# Installation
Based on the advice found [here](https://superuser.com/a/808818), we install "Make for Windows" following the directions found [here](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) (it's easiest to download the "Setup program", which is an executable installer).

You can optionally choose to download make.exe's source files so that you can view its code in a text editor.

By default, make is installed in "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\".

# Documentation
After installation, make.exe's manual can be found relative to its installation folder in ".\\doc\\make\\3.81\\make-381\\".  A list of make.exe's command-line options can be found in ".\\man\\".

# PATH Variables
Add make's binary folder (".\\bin\\") to Window's PATH variables if you don't want to have to type the executable's fully qualified path every time you want to call it in either cmd or Powershell.

# VSCode Integration
With make.exe installed, it's possible that we can use it in VSCode's tasks.json's "command" attribute.  Rather than calling the gcc compiler directly as VSCode defaults to, we could issue a "PS ...> make" command.
