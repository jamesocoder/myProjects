## VSCode's Command Palette
Ctrl+Shift+P is used to bring up a listing of all of VSCode's commands.  We can search for those related to Git by typing in "Git: ".  Alternatively, we can access Git's commands from the version control panel.

## Deleting branches
After a merge on Github, if a branch was deleted, this deletion only happens on the remote repository.  The deleted branch will still exist on the local clone.  You must switch off of the branch you want to delete locally by checking out a different one, then you can delete the local clone's copy of the branch.

## Pruning remote branch listings
After deleting a branch on the remote repository, VSCode will still list the deleted remote (origin/...) branch as an option to checkout.  To get rid of this non-existent listing, you must perform a Fetch (Prune) Git command.  This can be found under the Pull, Push sub-menu of the version control panel's ellipses menu.
