## char
The character dtype is basically equivalent to a byte. Unsigned, it can represent the numbers 0 to 255.  Alphabetic characters aren't the only thing that can be literally assigned to a char.  Printing a char using the "%d" format specifier will print a number in the dtype's range (The character's ASCII dec value or the literal number assigned to it).
