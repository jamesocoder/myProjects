The goal of this folder is to document my progress learning TypeScript.  I plan to write my Spotify shuffle program in this language.

# Current Commit Explanation

This commit renamed static.ts to classes.ts to reflect what it encompasses.  This is in preparation for an experiment with abstract classes.

# How To Run

With ts-node installed (`npm install -g ts-node`), use terminal command:<br>
`ts-node static.ts`

Without ts-node:
1. Transpile static.ts using tsc (TypeScript Compiler).  tsc will output a .js file
2. Run the .js file with the terminal command "node ___.js"

# notes.pdf

I used Microsoft's OneNote to make notes as I learned how to use TypeScript.  To retype all of it in this README while preserving formatting, pictures, and links would be too labor intensive so I will be uploading my notes as a PDF instead.
