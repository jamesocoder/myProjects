The goal of this folder is to document my progress learning TypeScript.  I plan to write my Spotify shuffle program in this language.

# Current Commit Explanation

This commit allowed me to practice using a favorite concept of mine: polymorphism.  I really enjoyed playing with classes in my Java-based Object Oriented Programming class, and I'm excited to see that it's possible in TypeScript.

# How To Run

With ts-node installed (`npm install -g ts-node`), use terminal command:<br>
`ts-node classes.ts`

Without ts-node:
1. Transpile classes.ts using tsc (TypeScript Compiler).  tsc will output a .js file
2. Run the .js file with the terminal command `node ___.js`

# notes.pdf

I used Microsoft's OneNote to make notes as I learned how to use TypeScript.  To retype all of it in this README while preserving formatting, pictures, and links would be too labor intensive so I will be uploading my notes as a PDF instead.
