The goal of this folder is to document my progress learning TypeScript.  I plan to write my Spotify shuffle program in this language.

# Current Commit Explanation

This commit experiments with static class properties and methods.

Note how the only thing special about static class methods is that they allow you to use them without instantiating the class.

# How To Run

1. Transpile static.ts using tsc (TypeScript Compiler).  tsc will output a .js file
2. Run the .js file with the terminal command "node ___.js"

# notes.pdf

I used Microsoft's OneNote to make notes as I learned how to use TypeScript.  To retype all of it in this README while preserving formatting, pictures, and links would be too labor intensive so I will be uploading my notes as a PDF instead.
