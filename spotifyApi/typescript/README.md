The goal of this folder is to document my progress learning TypeScript.  I plan to write my Spotify shuffle program in this language.

# Current Commit Explanation

This commit expands the TypeScript class experiment in the last commit by implementing the Getter/Setter syntax within it.

# How To Run

With ts-node installed (npm install -g ts-node), use terminal command:
<br>ts-node static.ts

1. Transpile static.ts using tsc (TypeScript Compiler).  tsc will output a .js file
2. Run the .js file with the terminal command "node ___.js"

# notes.pdf

I used Microsoft's OneNote to make notes as I learned how to use TypeScript.  To retype all of it in this README while preserving formatting, pictures, and links would be too labor intensive so I will be uploading my notes as a PDF instead.
