# BigotBlocker

## Purpose

After watching [The Brainwashing of My Dad (2015)](https://www.thebrainwashingofmydad.com) and reading through this [Quora response](https://qr.ae/pYiDGM), I was inspired to create a tool that would help us break our friends and family out of their propagandistic echo chambers.  We can't rely on social media algorithms to push less extreme views.  We've all seen these platforms contribute to the rise of rage-baiters and fearmongers.  Content that invokes the most emotion, whether good or bad, often receives the most engagement and the recommendation algorithms mistakingly perceive that as a good thing.  It's all too easy for a user to teach the algorithm to only show them content that confirms their own biases, slowly building up an echo chamber around them until they are eventually surrounded by the most extreme creators, willing to accept any lie that supports their manipulated emotions.

The days of unbiased news media that presented confirmed facts instead of opinions seem to be all but gone.

This project aims to stop that.  We'll break those echo chambers down and expose our indoctrinated loved ones to more reasonable opinions.  We'll fight against the media that is replacing understanding and compromise with hate and totalitarianism.

## Methodology

Taking inspiration from the 2015 documentary, this app will rely on the user gaining access to their loved one's media accounts in order to block known bad actors.  We'll have a point of interaction that automatically unsubscribes the account from them and blocks them with the intent of getting extremist content out of the account's recommendations.

There should be toggles that allows the user to customize the app's behavior according to what they think their loved one will be most receptive to.  The app's actions would range from subtly removing only the most extreme creators from an account to removing all bad actors and replacing them with blatantly opposite creators.  A less tech saavy person wouldn't think much of their usual creators suddenly disappearing from their feed, replaced by more moderate ones.  A more astute person would notice that something was amiss and may even react negatively.

The user should also be able to see our list of good and bad actors and the spectrum that we place them on.  They should also be able to customize who the app subscribes the account to in case they don't agree with our rating of them.  There should also be forms that allow a user to suggest changes to the ratings of creators, given some evidence showing why.  This transparency will help convince users that our app can be trusted.

## Current Goal

We'll initially target YouTube since I know many of my friends and family spend a ton of time on there.  We'll set up a site that connects to the user's YouTube account and then unsubscribes them from a channel.  This will be our initial target for a minimum test of capability.

## Special Thanks

Here, I'll compile a list of all those who inspired me throughout this project.  First, I'll list them anonymously then, I'll list them by name if they wish.

- The activist who brought many sources of inspiration together for me to stumble onto years later
- The friend who suggested the catchier name of BigotBlocker instead of De-RadicalizeMe for this project
